Building and installing PARAVIS module
===============================================

PARAVIS is a light SALOME module that wraps ParaView GUI and makes it available in
SALOME GUI.

Like any other SALOME module, PARAVIS requires PARAVIS_ROOT_DIR environment variable to be set to PARAVIS
installation directory.

Specific prerequisites:
- cmake 2.4.5 or higher should be installed, path to cmake executable
should be added to PATH environment variable.
- ParaView-3.4.0, both the build directory and the source files

Environment variables needed for correct detection of ParaView location:
- PVSRCHOME - points at the root of ParaView source directory tree
- PVINSTALLHOME - points at the top of ParaView build tree (currently, due to some drawbacks in its buld procedure
ParaView should not be installed, its build directory is used instead).

It also requires common SALOME environment including GUI_ROOT_DIR and
other standard SALOME prerequisites.

As soon as the environment is set, execute the following commands in a shell:

mkdir PARAVIS_BUILD
cd PARAVIS_BUILD
../PARAVIS_SRC/build_configure
../PARAVIS_SRC/configure --prefix=${PARAVIS_ROOT_DIR}
make 
make docs
make install

PARAVIS module can be launched using the following commands:

- Light SALOME configuration

runLightSalome.sh --modules="PARAVIS"

or

- Full SALOME configuration

runSalome --modules="PARAVIS"
