3 - propagate the update of filters connected directly or not (typically ExtractGroup) to the MEDReader when the groups have been updated.
UC : ForMEDReader16.med, then extractgroup, then return to MEDReader properties and select zeField3_1 & zeField4_1 -> ExtractGroup filter is out of date and "Apply" button not green.


Known bug :
-----------

- Extract cell type + Extract Group

Warning for users :
